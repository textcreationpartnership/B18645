            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>The <hi>CASE</hi> of the <hi>Church-Wardens,</hi> and other the Principal Inhabitants of the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-Hamblet of St. <hi>Mary White-Chapel,</hi> in the County of <hi>Middlesex,</hi> touching a Bill for the making the Hamblet of <hi>Wapping</hi> a distinct Parish.</head>
            <p>THE accidental Poor of the said Upper-Hamblet are of late very much increased, they being now above Eight times as many as they were a few Years since; and the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion-Poor and Nurse-Children, are also very much increased, and the Charges of the Repairs of the High-ways in the said Upper-Hamblet, is also very great, and much increased, there being a very Great and Wide Road leading through the same, out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try into <hi>London,</hi> which is very much worn. And there is in the said Upper-Hamblet, a Street against the Church and Church-Yard to Pave, which is Twenty Rods long, and half the breadth of the High-way, which was formerly Paved by an Act of Parliament, made in the Two and Thirtieth Year of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, which hath run to Ruine, and hath been of late Years Gravelled with the rest of the High-ways, to save the Charges of Paving. And there is now an Order of Sessions to Pave it again; which of Necessity must be done. And whereas the Repairs of the High-ways in the said Upper-Hamblet, formerly did not cost above Eighteen Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> and the Principal Inhabitants did not pay towards the same, above Twelve Pence a Piece by the Year, the Gravel being then dug upon the Common, the Repairs of the said High-ways did last Year, amount unto the Sum of Two Hundred Twenty Six Pounds, Six Shillings and Two Pence; as appears by the Surveyors Accompts, they being then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained (as they must also for the future be) to buy Gravel for the same.</p>
            <p>That by such Charges of Repairs as aforesaid, the said Inhabitants are not only very much already impoverished, but they are by several Acts of Parliament obliged to Repair the said High-ways, better than they have of late been done; and not only so, but they are also by an Order lately made by the Bench of Justices of the Peace, obliged to Repair more High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, and particularly one High-way of Eighty Rods and upwards, which leads to the Hamblet of <hi>Wapping White-Chapel,</hi> which was not used to be Repaired by the Parish of <hi>White-Chapel</hi> till these Two Years last past, the Charges of doing all which will contribute a great deal more to Impoverishing of the said Inhabitants; and should the Hamblet of <hi>Wapping</hi> be made a distinct Parish, it would exceedingly Load and Impoverish the said Inhabitants by depriving them of the Contributions (which were considerable) of the said Hamblet of <hi>Wap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping</hi> towards the Repairs of the High-ways aforesaid, the said Hamblet of <hi>Wapping</hi> (which about Twelve Years ago (according to the Computation in the Books of the Hearth-Money) did contain as many Houses within Thirty Five, or thereabouts, as the said Upper-Hamblet did) containing now above One Third part of as many Houses as the said Upper-Hamblet doth.</p>
            <p>By making the said Hamblet of <hi>Wapping</hi> a distinct Parish, the said Upper-Hamblet would be yet further loaded with the Repairs of the Church of <hi>White-Chapel,</hi> the said Hamblet of <hi>Wapping</hi> having of late Years paid Twelve or Fourteen Pound a Year for their Proportion of the Repairs of the said Church; which thereby will all fall upon the said Upper-Hamblet, who are too much Impoverished already.</p>
            <p>By making the said Hamblet of <hi>Wapping</hi> a distinct Parish, the said Upper-Hamblet will sustain such Cost and Damage as aforesaid, without any considerable Benefit, if any at all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruing to them in Recompence thereof, for that whatsoever the Charges of the Paving of the Streets in the said Hamblet of <hi>Wapping</hi> having of late amounted unto, (there being therein no Gravel High-Ways) are far less, and no Ways comparable to those of Paving and Repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Streets and High-ways in the said Upper-Hamblet, which are more numerous, and much wider, and a great deal more Worn than those in the said Hamblet of <hi>Wapping.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The said Inhabitants therefore hope, That in case it shall seem Reasonable to this Honourable House, to make the said Hamblet of</hi> Wapping <hi>a distinct Parish, yet, That the same shall be no Prejudice to the Parish of</hi> White-Chapel. <hi>But that the said Hamblet shall still continue subject to the Repairs of the Church and High-ways of the said Parish, as formerly.</hi>
